# Letters From A Designer

Dear Designer,

You have a beautiful soul and a gentle heart. You are kind. I love and appreciate these qualities.

However, it pains me to see that you might be holding yourself back from reaching your full potential. It frustrates me to witness how you're making your career and life unnecessarily difficult by being overly accommodating and not standing up for yourself.

I know that you have so much more to offer and achieve, and it hurts me to see you settle for less.

So, here I'm using the pages in this book to pour out my inner screams to help you unlock your full potential as a Designer, gain new perspectives and break free from self-limitations.

This is not a time to be offended.

This is the time to reflect on your actions and be brutally honest with yourself.

You have the power to break free from the limitations you've set for yourself and become a stronger, braver designer.

So, please take this as a reminder of your potential and a call to action to start living up to it.
