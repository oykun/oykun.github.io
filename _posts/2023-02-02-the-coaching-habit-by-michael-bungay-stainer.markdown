<p>Focusing on the good you can do for others than yourself was an interesting perspective to build habits. I found the practical tips about how to phrase some questions useful such as using "What..." instead of "Why..." which may come a bit offensive. As an introvert, I always struggled with small talk or how to initiate a conversation. The practical questions such as "What is on your mind?" was useful.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The essence of coaching lies in helping others and unlocking their potential.</li>

<li>To build an effective new habit, you need five essential components: a reason, a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan.</li>

<li>Think less about what your habit can do for you, and more about how this new habit will help a person or people you care about.</li>

<li>Ask one question at a time. Just one question at a time.</li>

<li>An almost fail-safe way to start a chat that quickly turns into a real conversation is the question, "What's on your mind?" It's something of a Goldilocks question, walking a fine line so it is neither too open nor broad not too narrow and confining.</li>

<li>Call them forward to learn, improve and grow, rather than just to get something sorted out.</li>

<li>Tell less and ask more. Your advice is not as good as you think it is.</li>

<li>"And what else?" works so well because it keeps people generating options and keeps you shut up.</li>

<li>One of your roles as a manager and a leader is to have answers. We are just trying to slow down the rush to this role as your default behaviour.</li>

<li>Reframe the question so it starts with "What." instead of "Why did you do that?" ask "What were you hoping for here?" instead of "Why did you think this was a good idea?" ask "What made you choose this course of action?"</li>

<li>You want your people to feel that working with you is a place of reward, not risk.</li>

<li>Get comfortable with silence.</li>

<li>One of the most compelling things you can do after asking a question is to genuinely listen to the answer. Stay curious, my friend.</li>

<li>Saying Yes more slowly means being willing to stay curious before committing.</li>
