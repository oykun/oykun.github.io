<p>You don't need the perfectly systemized plan to have a successfull business. Focus on giving the best service possible to the small number of people and improve/invent as you get feedback. Don't fear to be casual and human in the process.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what's not working.</li>

<li>When you are onto something great, it won't feel like revolution. It'll feel like uncommon sense.</li>

<li>We all have lots of ideas, creations, and projects. When you present one to the world and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as is. Instead, get back to improving and inventing.</li>

<li>Don't wait years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response.</li>

<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that you say, "Hell yeah!".</li>

<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers. Make every decision - even decision about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone - according to what's best for your customers.</li>

<li>The way to grow your business is to focus entirely on your existing customer. Just thrill them, and they'll tell everyone.</li>

<li>It's a big world. You can laudly leave out 99 percent of it. Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you becuse you've shown how much you value them.</li>

<li>Context hiring:"Anyone have a friend who is good with Linux? Yeah? Is he cool? OK, tell him to start tomorrow."</li>

<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you re back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>

<li>Whatever you make, it's your creation, so make it your personal dream come true.</li>
</ul>
