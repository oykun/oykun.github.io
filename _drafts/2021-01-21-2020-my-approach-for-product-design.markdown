Hi there, here I wanted to share my usual flow for creating digital products. Let's do this 🙂

<h2>1. Understand the product</h2>
First I talk to team from CEO, CTO and engineers to anyone who knows the product & business, and even to few clients if possible. I look for answers to questions like;
What is the product?
What is it for?
What is it for?
What are the use-cases?
What problem is it trying to solve for who?
What is your timeline? Do you have any specific release date?
What is your budget?
What platforms does it run on?
Do you already have engineers and people who knows the relevant business deeply as I will need to talk to them from the very early stages?
Do you already have an alpha/beta version?
- If so, how long has it been out?
- Did you test it with real users?
- Did you get any feedback?
- What does and doesn't work well?
- Does it struggle to solve the core problem the app trying to solve for people
- …
If it is a redesign;
- Why do you want to redesign?
- What are the problems you have faced with the earlier version?
- Is there going to be new features in the new version?
- …
Are there any competitor products?
- If so, how is your product different?
- Why would someone choose your product over others?
- …

so on…
I write down the key points.

sometimes I get messy on paper 🙃

<h2>2. Review the current product (if there is any)</h2>
Take screenshots of current product, put them in order (first time user & returned user) and write comments for each screen.
Note what the negatives and positives I see.
Note anything unclear to ask.
Ask how/why specific design decisions were given as seen.

<h2>3. Research & Study</h2>
- Learn as much as I can about the relevant business by reading news, searching tweets to hear from real users, …
- I talk to the people around me who might be using this product and I ask what they would need to have in such product
- Research about the product, competitor products, …
- Note good and bad points of competitor products
- Create a moodboard
- Write down detailed questions

If possible
- Arrange a meet up with users from the previous product and potential users for the new product. Ask their opinions, where they struggle, what they like, what they want, so on…

<h2>4. Low fidelity prototype</h2>
- Collect real data from the relevant team member and design the flow based on the most common and the least common scenarios.
- Design a basic greyscale prototype for FTU and Returned user flows
- Note questions as you come across and talk to relevant people such as engineers, founders, marketing, …
- Connect screens on Marvel app

if time allows me, I go through some basic sketches first

then grey scale designs in Sketch app.

an another example from a different project where I show improvements side by side. Example; more human approach with welcome sentence in human language instead of number that is not very clear

<h2>5. Prototype presentation meeting for team</h2>
- Walk the team through interactive prototype via Marvel
- Explain why/how I gave specific design decisions as I go through screens
- Ask and note teams feedbacks


Meeting with engineers
- Discussing technical side of project
- Do engineers see any problem in the flow?
- Do they have any suggestions?

<h2>6. Make updates from the meeting notes</h2>
- Go through notes from the meeting and make revisions
- Low fidelity prototype turns into high fidelity



Second prototype presentation meeting with team
- Share the updated prototype
- Take notes
- Once we are happy with overall flow, talk to engineers about implementations detailsEngineers starts implementation for core

↓

Meanwhile I start UI design 🎨

I also work on animations for key parts such as how editing medicine schedule works at calendar view. At this stage I focus on animations that are relevant to usability
Btw, I tried many prototyping tools including Framer, Facebook Origami, Adobe After Effects… Currently I'm using "Principle For Mac"

<h2>7. Design presentation meeting with team</h2>
- Walk the team through interactive design via Marvel
- Explain why/how I gave specific design decisions as I go through screens
- Share animation ideas as well
- Ask and note teams feedbacks

Meeting with engineers
- Discussing technical side of project
- Do engineers see any problem in the flow?
- Do they have any suggestions?

<h2>8. Implementation with engineers</h2>
- Work closely with engineers for the implementation
- Often review the progress in different devices and platforms
- Try all the extreme cases as well as the most commons
- Point and fix all the bugs with engineers
- Perfect the meaningful animations with developers
...


<h2>9. Share the alpha/beta with test group (if we have any)</h2>
- Arrange a meetup with some potential users to share the product
- Watch how they use the app and note where they struggle
- Ask for feedback
...


<h2>10. Public "beta" release and studying data</h2>
Study the data for things like;
- if people are being able to use it easily
- if it is solving the core problem for users (example; if people can easily order medications, if not, at what point they give up, …)
- And don't forget to celebrate the hard work with team 🙂 🍺
