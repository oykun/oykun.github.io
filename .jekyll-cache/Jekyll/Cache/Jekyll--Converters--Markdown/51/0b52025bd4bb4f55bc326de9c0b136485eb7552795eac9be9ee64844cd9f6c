I"¡<p>I never had a mentor, but I had heroes, I did put myself in their shoes when I needed to make design or business decisions. I worked hard to align quality of my work to my heroes. Today I donâ€™t even remember their names. There were so many of them. Btw, it doesn't have to be for the design industry, isn't it same when trying to be a better parent or partner, taking examples from our own parents or so... </p>
