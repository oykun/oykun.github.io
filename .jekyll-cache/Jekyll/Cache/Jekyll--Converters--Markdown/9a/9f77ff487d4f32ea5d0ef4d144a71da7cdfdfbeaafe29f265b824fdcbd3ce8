I"<p>Many designers shy away from increasing their rates, fearing it will scare clients away and put them under pressure to deliver higher-quality work.
Understandable concerns with the common fixed mindset.
However, if you want to grow as a Designer, you must be comfortable with losing the wrong type of clients who demand cheap and low-quality designs. 
You need to level up and attract the right kind of clients. Type of clients who</p>
<ul>
  <li>value design</li>
  <li>value quality</li>
  <li>are easy to work with</li>
  <li>pay premium \($ 
By charging higher rates, you are signalling to potential clients that you offer a level of expertise, professionalism and dedication that sets you apart from the competition.
Important detail though; I'm not suggesting you charge more if your design doesn't deliver it. You need to master your skills first. After all, higher-value clients who pay premium\)$ will often come with a certain level of risk and expect higher quality work to lower that business risk.
Don’t let this stress you though.
Since you are charging higher $$$ now, you can dedicate</li>
  <li>more time</li>
  <li>more focus</li>
  <li>more care</li>
  <li>more resources
You will see how this approach influences the outcome of your work positively.
By charging more, you are enabling yourself to deliver higher-quality work, as a positive consequence.
By charging more, you are not helping only yourself with higher income, but your client with a higher quality of work.
By charging more, you are attracting the right type of clients who value design and trust your advice.

By charging more … 
It is a win-win situation for you and your clients!
