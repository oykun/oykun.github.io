<p>This is more of a personal update. I wanted to document my thought process behind this radical decision for my career. A direction I thought I'd never take. I guess "never say never" proves itself true again.</p>

<p>I have accepted a job offer from a Tier1 Investment Bank as a Vice President of Design role. This  has been my first month and yes I have taken a challenge for sure! </p>

<p>I'm a self taught designer and (used-to-be) developer. The way I learned all my skills were taking new challenges in the real world with real projects. I've written more about that earlier at "<a href="https://oykun.com/2013/self-taught-with-passion.html" title="Self-taught with Passion">Self-taught with Passion</a>". </p>

<p>Things have been going a bit too well in my freelance world. I used to have lots of interesting projects coming through, meeting new people, making good earning, having my own schedule... All and all good but the biggest challenge I was able to take was based on the projects, and all I was able to improve with those were technical skills. However I wanted to learn a completely new business and focus more on improving soft skills such as time-management, presentation skills, communication, managing teams and projects in a new environment, working with people in person... This job offer has it all and more.</p>

<p>I will share my learnings in coming weeks and months in here. However so far, I love the difficult situation I've put myself in! There is so much I need to learn to make this job going as well as my freelancing experience.</p>
