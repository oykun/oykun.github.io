In early days on internet, .com was the king. It was an unconscious extension for any person. It was also an important factor to rate good at search engines. Then with the explosion of websites, finding the domain name with .com extension has started become a nightmare. Countless new extensions have started come out and people have started to use Google more often for anything than directly typing urls, so having a clear domain name with .com extension has become not so important.
