I"A<h2>We all have 24 hours in a day. Entrepreneur to 5 products and 4 kids with well balanced life or a single full time employee who struggles to find time to do a simple reading/writing.</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post about New Challenges, I have started a full time job after many years of freelancing. One of the first challenges I've been facing is better time and energy management.</p>

<p>When I used to freelance, I was was able to work on multiple things during the day including my personal projects, client projects, accounting errands, home errands, so on... However my current role in the Investment Banking requires me to join many meetings during the day and make sure that product teams have the designs they need to proceed in agreed timelines. So, once the working hours start, I'm 100% in this full time work.</p>

<p>First few weeks I have struggled to manage personal projects and errands. I can no longer do long nights to catch up on things. At least for now, it is how it is. I ran out of energy and creativity after a long day of work and meetings. I'm hoping to adjust to this new pace in coming days and weeks. </p>

<p>So, for now what I do is, <br />
<strong>I get up when I wake up.</strong> I know it sounds silly, however I believe it applies to most of us, alarm goes off or we just wake up but we waste 10, 15+ mins turning in bed if not longer, fall asleep for 5mins, wake up again, so on and on... You don't get the rest you are after nor use the time for something productive.</p>

<p>I will be sharing my learnings in the coming weeks and months in this blog. However so far, I love the difficult and challenging situation I've put myself in! There is so much I need to learn and improve to make this job going as well as my freelancing experience. I'm excited to improve myself and share with you all.</p>
