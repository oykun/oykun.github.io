I"	<p>You are a designer and want higher-value clients who pay higher $$$ dollars.</p>

<p>I'm with you. We all do (in a way).</p>

<p>However, if you keep the $$$ income as the primary goal in your conversations with clients, it will completely affect your attitude, vibe...</p>

<p>You are going to unintentionally keep bringing the subject to YOU and $. Not necessarily by directly saying that, but your questions and impatience will be around $. The client will sense that and may only be willing to pay a low to average $ amount, especially if you've been preaching about your pixels.</p>

<p>Here is a mindset shift I need to consider.</p>

<p>Help.</p>

<p>Do not sell!</p>

<p>Talk to them just like you'd do with a close friend of yours who wants to start a business.</p>

<p>Give them your genuine advice, thoughts, and tips about the business instead of talking only about your designs and portfolio and how much it will cost and what a great design you do and ...</p>

<p>Brainstorm ideas about how you all can make a better product, what you can offer to clients, how you can position the offer in the market to go beyond the competition, how you can lower the cost to increase the revenue,...</p>

<p>Show them how you are focused on making their business a success, not your wallet thicker (yet).</p>

<p>Share without the fear of revealing secrets. There are no secrets. Help them succeed with or without you.</p>

<p>Truly care for them and their business. They will see, sense that care. They will trust you for it. Then, money won't be an issue! They will pay you the best $$$ they can. They will recommend you to their friends and other businesses. They will be your best allies in the business world for other high-value projects.</p>

<p>Btw, I'm not asking you to fake the care for a higher pay. You have to deliver for that trust! That's why this is a mindset shift instead of a 1-off tactic.</p>

<p>For over 25 years in design, I've approached people with this mindset, experiencing great satisfaction, making friends with various business owners, and earning $$$ millions of dollars along the way.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it's so difficult to find designers who take time with clients (better term: friends) and truly care for their team and business which makes it easier for you to stand out by doing it.</p>
