<p>Dear Designer,</p>

<p>You have a beautiful soul and a gentle heart. You are kind. I love and appreciate these qualities.</p>

<p>However, it pains me to see that you might be holding yourself back from reaching your full potential. It frustrates me to witness how youâ€™re making your career and life unnecessarily difficult by being overly accommodating and not standing up for yourself.</p>

<p>I know that you have so much more to offer and achieve, and it hurts me to see you settle for less.</p>

<p>So, here Iâ€™m using the pages in this book to pour out my inner screams to help you unlock your full potential as a Designer, gain new perspectives and break free from self-limitations.</p>

<p>This is not a time to be offended.</p>

<p>This is the time to reflect on your actions and be brutally honest with yourself.</p>

<p>You have the power to break free from the limitations youâ€™ve set for yourself and become a stronger, braver designer.</p>

<p>So, please take this as a reminder of your potential and a call to action to start living up to it.</p>
