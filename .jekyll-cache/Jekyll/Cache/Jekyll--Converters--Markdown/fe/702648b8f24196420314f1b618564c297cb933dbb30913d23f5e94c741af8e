I"3<p>&lt;h2Replacing smartphone with a book.&lt;/h2&gt;</p>

<p>We all want to read more and we always struggle finding time for it. I used to be in the same situation and feel guilty of not reading enough. After all, how could I even find time with 2 kids, day time job, multiple side projects, list goes on... </p>

<p>Then this happened:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">During the past few months, I replaced my phone with a book and this happened 📚+ kindle.<br /><br />Whenever I had a moment here and there, while waiting in line, walking to tube, lunch time, ... I grabbed my book instead of phone. <br /><br />It turns out I actually have had enough time to read 🤷‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/eURbLh47Sb">pic.twitter.com/eURbLh47Sb</a></p>&mdash; oykun.com (@oykun) <a href="https://twitter.com/oykun/status/1196430204081725441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Yes it is an old tweet and it proves the effectiveness as it still stands. </p>

<p>We think that we need to spare a big chunk of time during the day to read. Yes, that would be ideal but if you can't do that, use the little bits of 5-10 mins here and there in your day to read. It quickly adds up!</p>
