<p>It's hard to believe it has been almost 8 years since my last blog post.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since then. I have had two kids, I read hundreds of books, I worked on tens of client projects, I experienced full time employment, I started and succeeded/failed many side projects, I have started investing in financial markets, I learned a lot and I want to start sharing it all in here.</p>

<p>This place will be like a public journal where I pour my experiences in fatherhood, design, development, just being human in general for better or worse. Iâ€™ll post short and easy to absorb articles as I have something to share. I hope you will find something useful, inspiring...</p>

<p>See you soon, stay safe...</p>
