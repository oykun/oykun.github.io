I"°<p>I never had a mentor, but I had heroes. I did put myself in their shoes when I needed to make design or business decisions. I worked hard to align quality of my work to my heroes. Today I donâ€™t even remember their names. There were so many of them. Btw, it doesn't have to be for the design industry, isn't it same when trying to be a better parent or partner, taking examples from our own parents or so... </p>

<p>Today we have an amazing community who is willing to help each other without expecting anything back. I personally know designers from big corporation to individual freelancers offering free mentoring. You can even directly reach out to ask questions, you will be surprised how kindly people respond you.</p>

<p>However, this ease of communication also made the contribution from these experienced designers more challenging. There is just not enough time to respond all, mentor all individually. Don't be discouraged with this.</p>

<blockquote>You do not need to be in active communication with your hero (which would make them your mentor), however you can follow their work, blog, Twitter, etc. to have an understanding of what they are up to and learn from them without requiring their time.</blockquote>

<p>You can have countless heroes to learn from instead of waiting for a space in their already tight calendar.</p>

<blockquote>You can share what you learn, be a hero to someone.</blockquote>

<p>Btw, in my 20 years of experience, I have received countless emails, messages asking for advice. I'm humbled by it and I have been doing my very best to respond every one of them. This is one of the reason why I have started this blog. I hope someone can find something useful.</p>
