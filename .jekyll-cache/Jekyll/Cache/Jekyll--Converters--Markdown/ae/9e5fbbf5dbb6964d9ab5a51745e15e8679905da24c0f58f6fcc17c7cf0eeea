I""<p>Invest in long term, Diversify, Don't stress to time the market, Stay calm ... It is not that complicated.</p>

<p>This week I tweeted about my regret in not investing earlier in life. I always thought I was in the minority who hasn't been investing at my age. To my surprise, I found out many others in similar age was in a similar position.</p>

<p>Here I wanted to extend the subject as I received numerous questions about this tweet. I will keep it short and sweet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ðŸ’¡ This is not financial advice. Please do your own research, I'm just sharing how I have been investing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have read numerous articles and many finance/investment related books, they all give very similar advice.</p>

<h3>Invest in long term</h3>
<p>I'm not the type of person to follow the stock market daily and try to time the market. I just want to put some money in investment and forget about it while it is growing itself on aside. For this scenario, Index Funds have been a lifesaver.</p>

<p>80% of my investment goes to long term Index Funds. I use Vanguard ISA account for Index Funds, it is trustworthy and has low fees. I did set up an Â£X of monthly direct debit payment from my bank to Vanguard and Vanguard to purchase Y% of each index fund monthly. It is all automated.</p>

<p>So far, I have made %40+ return in Index funds.</p>

<h3>Diversify</h3>
<p>When it comes to where to invest, diversification becomes key. Yes, I have my favourite Funds, however, I try to keep a good balance between logic and emotion. I invest in ~15 Funds with different weights at the moment. Big majority is for S&amp;P 500 (duh!), I also have some FTSE 100, Japan Stock Index, Target Retirement, Global Small Cap Index Fund, ...</p>

<p>Make your own research and diversify your money. So if one market does bad, another one will make it up.</p>

<h3>Individual Stocks</h3>
<p>OK, let's be honest, Index funds are boring :D in this case, boring is good though!</p>

<p>So for the remaining 20% of my money, I invest in Individual Stocks and Crypto. Currently, I'm using eToro for both, there are many other low fee alternatives for the Stock market. I purchase stocks from the companies I know and believe in such as Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc.</p>

<p>Stock market with Crypto is very volatile, looking at today, I have made ~%70 return</p>

<h3>Timing the Market</h3>
<p>You may have heard this phrase, people keep waiting for the market price to go down to buy. In an ideal world, it makes sense, however, we are living in a real and unpredictable world. Regardless market going up or down, you lose opportunity by waiting. I invest regularly without timing. If you look at it in the long term, your money grows despite all the volatilities. I don't sell when the market goes down and people panic sells, I see these times as great opportunities to buy even more.</p>

<p>I can write pages of advice for this subject, even a book :D Maybe I should : P</p>

<p>I will write follow up articles. For now, if you want to start investing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Vanguard ISA (up to Â£20k tax-free for UK) account.</li>
<li>Transfer whatever you can afford from your personal bank account to Vanguard. Â£100, Â£1000, ...</li>
<li>Buy some Index Fund, S&amp;P 500 is the most common one, it is even taken as a benchmark.</li>
<li>Congrats, you have invested now : )</li>
<li>Then, keep doing your research and expand your portfolio with more funds and stocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember; Invest in the long term, Diversify, Don't stress to time the market, Stay calm ... </p>

<p>It is not that complicated.</p>
