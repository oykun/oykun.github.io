<p>In early days on internet, .com was the king. It was an unconscious extension for any person. It was also an important factor to rate good at search engines. Then with the explosion of websites, finding the domain name with .com extension has started become a nightmare. Countless new extensions have started come out and people have started to use Google more often for anything than directly typing urls, so having a clear domain name with .com extension has become not so important.</p>

<p>Then a new problem has arised. Spams! Spammers has started to purchase cheap domain extensions like .work, .co, … and spam people with these extension and as a response, people have started to block and assign these emails as spam.</p>

<p>Since any online website heavily relies on email communication, you may want to reconsider the extension you are registering. There is a high chance of all your emails ending up in your visitors’ spam folder, and the only thing you can do is registering a new domain name with an extension like .com, an extension that does NOT cost $1.</p>
