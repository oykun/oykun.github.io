<p>I've been using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" title="Ruby on Rails" targer="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> for a few years now. It's the framework enabled me to build the products I have always wanted. However whenever I research anything about RoR online, I often come across an article argues how RoR is irrelevant in recent years, how it has no future and no one should waste time with it. Here I could write a long article argues otherwise with presenting data from <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/framework" target="_blank">builtwith website research</a> and all the <a href="https://remoteok.io/remote-ruby-jobs" target="_blank">job listings for Ruby</a>, but  I’m not here to defend RoR, I want to focus on a different point.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is just a tool to build our ideas, just like what Sketch or Figma is for designers. It works for some people and doesn’t for others. Don't waste your time trying to decide what framework to use or if you should change your existing framework because of a new flashy framework. If you're productive with what you have and enjoy using it, don't distract yourself with what others are using and go with whatever works for you.</p>

<blockquote>At the end of the day, what you build is more important than what you built it with.</blockquote>

<p>So, if it works for you, it is not dead. Use it.</p>
