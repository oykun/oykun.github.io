I"o<p>Many designers shy away from increasing their rates, fearing it will scare clients away and put them under pressure to deliver higher-quality work.</p>

<p>Understandable concerns with the common fixed mindset.</p>

<p>However, if you want to grow as a Designer, you must be comfortable with losing the wrong type of clients who demand cheap and low-quality designs.</p>

<p>You need to level up and attract the right kind of clients. Type of clients who</p>
<ul>
<li>value design</li>
<li>value quality</li>
<li>are easy to work with</li>
<li>pay premium $$$</li>
</ul>

<p>By charging higher rates, you are signalling to potential clients that you offer a level of expertise, professionalism and dedication that sets you apart from the competition.</p>

<p>Important detail though; I'm not suggesting you charge more if your design doesn't deliver it. You need to master your skills first. After all, higher-value clients who pay premium $$$ will often come with a certain level of risk and expect higher quality work to lower that business risk.</p>

<p>Don't let this stress you though.</p>

<p>Since you are charging higher $$$ now, you can dedicate</p>
<ul>
<li>more time</li>
<li>more focus</li>
<li>more care</li>
<li>more resources</li>
</ul>

<p>You will see how this approach influences the outcome of your work positively.</p>

<p>By charging more, you are enabling yourself to deliver higher-quality work, as a positive consequence.</p>

<p>By charging more, you are not helping only yourself with higher income, but your client with a higher quality of work.</p>

<p>By charging more, you are attracting the right type of clients who value design and trust your advice.</p>

<p>By charging more, you are becoming a better designer due to the environment it gives you.</p>

<p>By charging more ...</p>

<p>It is a win-win situation for you and your clients!</p>

<p>Charge More $$$!</p>
