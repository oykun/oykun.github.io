I"f<p>This is the book that introduced me to Stoicism and it has changed the way I looked at many things in life. I happen to appreciate my family time more, not to worry as much for the things I have no control over, and find more contentment in daily life. It is incredible how relatable the content of this ancient philosophy is in our day. A must-read.</p>
