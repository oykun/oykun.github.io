I"u<h2>We all have 24 hours in a day. Entrepreneur to 5 products and 4 kids with well balanced life or a single full time employee who struggles to find time to do a simple reading/writing.</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post about New Challenges, I have started a full time job after many years of freelancing. One of the first challenges I've been facing is better time and energy management.</p>

<p>When I used to freelance, I was was able to work on multiple things during the day including my personal projects, client projects, accounting errands, home errands, so on... However my current role in the Investment Banking requires me to join many meetings during the day and make sure that product teams have the designs they need to proceed in agreed timelines. So, once the working hours start, I'm 100% in this full time work.</p>

<p>First few weeks I have struggled to manage personal projects and errands. I can no longer do long nights to catch up on things. At least for now, it is how it is. I ran out of energy and creativity after a long day of work and meetings. I'm hoping to adjust to this new pace in coming days and weeks. </p>

<p>OK, but why? Well, things have been going a bit too well in my freelance world. I have had lots of interesting projects coming through, I have met new people, made good earning, had my own schedule... All and all good, I'm very grateful for all of it but the biggest challenge I was able to take was based on the projects, and all I was able to improve with those were technical skills. However I wanted to learn a completely new business and focus more on improving my soft skills in an another level such as time-management, presentation, communication, managing teams and projects in a new environment, working with people in person... This job offer has it all and more.</p>

<p>I will be sharing my learnings in the coming weeks and months in this blog. However so far, I love the difficult and challenging situation I've put myself in! There is so much I need to learn and improve to make this job going as well as my freelancing experience. I'm excited to improve myself and share with you all.</p>
