	<p>I've been using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" title="Ruby on Rails" targer="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> for a few years now. It's the framework enabled me to build the products I have always wanted. However whenever I research anything about RoR online, I often come across an article argues how RoR is irrelevant in recent years, how it has no future and no one should waste time with it. Here I could write a long article argues otherwise with presenting data from <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/framework" target="_blank">builtwith website research</a> and all the <a href="https://remoteok.io/remote-ruby-jobs" target="_blank">job listings for Ruby</a>, butÂ  Iâ€™m not here to defend RoR, I want to focus on a different point.</p>
	<p>Ruby on Rails is just a tool to build our ideas, just like what Sketch or Figma is for designers. It works for some people and doesnâ€™t for others. Don't waste your time trying to decide what framework to use or if you should change your existing framework because of a new flashy framework. If you're productive with what you have and enjoy using it, don't distract yourself with what others are using and go with whatever works for you.</p>
	<blockquote>At the end of the day, what you build is more important than what you built it with.</blockquote>
	<p>So, if it works for you, it is not dead. Use it.</p>
