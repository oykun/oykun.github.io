<p>This book took its place in my annual re-reading list. Lots of common sense practices in this book. I especially liked how Naval emphasises the importance of being a perpetual learner and reader which I greatly value too. I also appreciate his approach to happiness that comes from inner "peace" than any external goods we accumulate. An easy read I would recommend anyone to pick it up.</p>
