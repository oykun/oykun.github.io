	<p>I have been coding this simple Jekyll blog on my iPad as well as my MBP and I wanted to share my flow. This is not going to be a detailed post explaining every steps in details, but an overall flow. I can get in more details in a separate post maybe.</p>
	<p>I build this website in a very simple, lightweight way by using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> and hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="Github Pages">Github Pages</a> for free.</p>
	<p>This system allows me to run this blog without managing any database. I enjoy the simplicity and security of this system. This also makes it easy to manage from my iPad, all I need is a Git client and my choice is <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com" target="_blank">Working Copy App</a>.</p>
	<h3 class="mt5 mb0">Step 1</h3>
	<p>After I installed the app on my iPad, I entered my Github details and it listed all my repos. Then, all I needed to do was selecting the repo and Clone.</p>
	<div class="img-grey-bg"><img src="/assets/coding-on-ipad-1.jpg" alt="Working copy app on iPad" class="center" /></div>
	<h3 class="mt5 mb0">Step 2</h3>
	<p>Now I can edit my codes, create new files using the app. There are separate iOS IDEs that you can use, but I'm fine with the WorkingCopy, plus I don't want to over-complicate the flow.</p>

	<h3 class="mt5 mb0">Step 3</h3>
	<p>Once I'm done with the code updates, I hit Commit, write my commit message and Push.</p>
	<img src="/assets/coding-on-ipad-5.jpg" alt="Working copy app on iPad" class="center mb3" />
	<p class="mt3">That's all :) Github Pages takes care of the rest and the updates go live in less than a minute.</p>
	<p>When I need to continue on my MBP, I first do Git Pull to get the updates. The same applies to my iPad, I do Pull after making a Push from my MBP. So, both system gets the latest code and there is no conflict.</p>
	<p>BTW, the same flow works on my iPhone as well.</p>
