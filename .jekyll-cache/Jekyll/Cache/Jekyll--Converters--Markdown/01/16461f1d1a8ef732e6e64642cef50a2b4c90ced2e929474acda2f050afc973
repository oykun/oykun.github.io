<p>I'm an introvert. Unfortunately, I have discovered this term and its true meaning quite late in my life. I have always been the person who talks less in a large group. I've always preferred to be either by myself or with a small number of people where I can build better connections. I need my space to be creative and I have always been facing questions like "Are you all right?!", "What is the matter?!", "Why are you so quiet?!" and treated me like there was something wrong with me and I needed to be more social, more talkative. Now I know better!</p>
