<p>I've been using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" title="Ruby on Rails" targer="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> for a few years now. It's the framework enabled me to build the products I have always wanted. However whenever I research anything about RoR online, I often come across an article argues how RoR is irrelevant in recent years, how it has no future and no one should waste time with it. Here I could write a long article argues otherwise with presenting data from <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/framework" target="_blank">builtwith website research</a> and all the <a href="https://remoteok.io/remote-ruby-jobs" target="_blank">job listings for Ruby</a>, but  I’m not here to defend RoR, I want to focus on a different point.</p>
