&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can already call yourself a &quot;Designer&quot;. Everybody in this world is a designer. What you want to be is an &quot;Excellent Designer&quot;. To become that;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explore! Do not worry about specialising. You will have time for that. Take whatever comes your path in design. Find out what you are good at, what you are terrible at, what you enjoy/hate doing... You will discover who you are and what you have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you explore, build lifelong relationships with people. Make friends with clients, Care for them, care for their business, You will never be alone in your life-long journey with design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t be lazy! Don&apos;t sit around and wait for people to give you work. Do not be satisfied with the bare minimum to save the day. Go above and beyond. Show what you can do, first to yourself! Make the most of the opportunities you have for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move your head out of your screen! The answer to being an exceptional designer is not all in the pixels you move around. It&apos;s rather in the world out there. Go out, see a musical, get lost in a museum, try surfing, try new things. As you expand your experiences, you will notice the way you see design will evolve for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read! Not as in moving your eyes over the letters, but looking through them. Study them! Not only design books but philosophy, architecture, science, history, fiction, nonfiction... Expand your mind&apos;s horizon. Design is everywhere, fed by everything. Read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t worry about good design when you first start! Just design! Accumulate as many ideas, techniques, styles, approaches, art movements as you can. Your creativity will harmonise them with your self-being. It will guide you to your unique sense in design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn the rules. Not to follow them. To know what, when and how to break them. Be brave, make your own rules. Explore and see what you can do with design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grow tough skin! This world will be brutal at times. People will rip your design apart, change it, reject it. Don&apos;t let this process discourage you. Take these moments as opportunities for your growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earn! Don&apos;t shy away from earning with design. It is not an insult to your craft. Design gives so much to people and businesses, do not undervalue your contribution. Cherish the endless possibilities Design has to offer, earn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years will pass… If you do these and more, you&apos;ll find yourself in high places. The imposter syndrome will kick in, you will question your abilities. Don&apos;t give away to that inner voice! Look back at the years you put in the hard work with passion and the relationships you&apos;ve built. Acknowledge that your journey brought you there and you deserve it! Own it! Stay humble though and hungry, forever… There is always more to learn in design. This is a lifelong journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, Some days will be tough, some easy. You will need to do things you do not enjoy. Accept the design with everything it has to offer with ups and downs. When you stand back, take a moment and look at the big picture, you will see a beautiful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never ever forget! There is more to design than the pixels you see on your screen. Develop your confidence, communication, negotiation, your human skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve every faith in you! You will have an amazing, rich, satisfying life with Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Love&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandable concerns with the common fixed mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to grow as a Designer, you must be comfortable with losing the wrong type of clients who demand cheap and low-quality designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to level up and attract the right kind of clients. Type of clients who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are easy to work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay premium $$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By charging higher rates, you are signalling to potential clients that you offer a level of expertise, professionalism and dedication that sets you apart from the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important detail though; I&apos;m not suggesting you charge more if your design doesn&apos;t deliver it. You need to master your skills first. After all, higher-value clients who pay premium $$$ will often come with a certain level of risk and expect higher quality work to lower that business risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t let this stress you though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you are charging higher $$$ now, you can dedicate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see how this approach influences the outcome of your work positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By charging more, you are enabling yourself to deliver higher-quality work, as a positive consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By charging more, you are not helping only yourself with higher income, but your client with a higher quality of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By charging more, you are attracting the right type of clients who value design and trust your advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By charging more, you are becoming a better designer due to the environment it gives you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By charging more ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a win-win situation for you and your clients!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charge More $$$!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Many designers shy away from increasing their rates, fearing it will scare clients away and put them under pressure to deliver higher-quality work.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unlock higher $$$ income with this approach as a Designer</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/unlock-higher-income-with-this-approach-as-a-designer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unlock higher $$$ income with this approach as a Designer" /><published>2024-02-25T00:01:01+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-25T00:01:01+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/unlock-higher-income-with-this-approach-as-a-designer</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/unlock-higher-income-with-this-approach-as-a-designer.html">&lt;p&gt;You are a designer and want higher-value clients who pay higher $$$ dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m with you. We all do (in a way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you keep the $$$ income as the primary goal in your conversations with clients, it will completely affect your attitude, vibe...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are going to unintentionally keep bringing the subject to YOU and $. Not necessarily by directly saying that, but your questions and impatience will be around $. The client will sense that and may only be willing to pay a low to average $ amount, especially if you&apos;ve been preaching about your pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a mindset shift I need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not sell!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to them just like you&apos;d do with a close friend of yours who wants to start a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give them your genuine advice, thoughts, and tips about the business instead of talking only about your designs and portfolio and how much it will cost and what a great design you do and ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm ideas about how you all can make a better product, what you can offer to clients, how you can position the offer in the market to go beyond the competition, how you can lower the cost to increase the revenue,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show them how you are focused on making their business a success, not your wallet thicker (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share without the fear of revealing secrets. There are no secrets. Help them succeed with or without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly care for them and their business. They will see, sense that care. They will trust you for it. Then, money won&apos;t be an issue! They will pay you the best $$$ they can. They will recommend you to their friends and other businesses. They will be your best allies in the business world for other high-value projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, I&apos;m not asking you to fake the care for a higher pay. You have to deliver for that trust! That&apos;s why this is a mindset shift instead of a 1-off tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over 25 years in design, I&apos;ve approached people with this mindset, experiencing great satisfaction, making friends with various business owners, and earning $$$ millions of dollars along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, it&apos;s so difficult to find designers who take time with clients (better term: friends) and truly care for their team and business which makes it easier for you to stand out by doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">You are a designer and want higher-value clients who pay higher $$$ dollars.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Practising distraction-free creativity</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/practising-distraction-free-creativity.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Practising distraction-free creativity" /><published>2024-02-21T00:01:01+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-21T00:01:01+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/practising-distraction-free-creativity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/practising-distraction-free-creativity.html">&lt;p&gt;The design world is filled with exciting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see Designers on X who are creating Framer templates, experimenting with 3D, writing newsletters, starting design subscription agencies, selling icon packs and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&apos;s tempting to chase them all. I&apos;ve given in to that temptation as well, many times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can do anything, but not everything&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written about &lt;a href=&quot;/tackling-fomo-driven-social-media-struggles&quot;&gt;Tackling FOMO-driven social media struggles&lt;/a&gt; for how to be okay with not chasing everything we see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say you are set with 1 thing you want to do, however, now distractions usually come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how it is; You are decisive in creating a Framer template, you open Framer, then you get a notification from X, you tab on it, after 30mins you realize you have been browsing the feed. You go back to Framer, and while doing that, you see your Mail app, you have been waiting for an email, so you check, you find yourself spending another 30 minutes going through emails, and so on and on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few practical tips that have kept me away from this endless cycle and helped me stay focused on my task;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/phone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;phone&quot; class=&quot;max-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Removing distractions from my phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned off all the notifications on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no counts on the app icons, no Lock Screen notifications, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete silence. The only exception is the calls and messages from my wife and parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are no temptations to check what those numbers may hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/notes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;notes&quot; class=&quot;max-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Removing distractions from my laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep my MacBook as minimal as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have multiple apps open. Randomly look at the mail app, click a link that opens Safari, more links in there, then an email notification, read that, then realise I spent 2 hours clicking around while I needed to write my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m no longer running multiple apps at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&apos;m writing, I only have the Note app open.&lt;br /&gt;
If I&apos;m designing, I only have the Figma app open.&lt;br /&gt;
If I&apos;m replying to emails, I only have the Mail app open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&apos;t have anything on my desktop, in my downloads folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary goal nowadays is Writing the book. So all I have on my dock is the Notes app. When I open my laptop in the morning, that&apos;s the only option I see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;x&quot; class=&quot;max-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Removing distractions from Social media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed I only have X on my phone and notification is off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started using it more as a one-way stream to share what I have to share and interact with the replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use Lists more intentionally now. I have lists for &quot;Readers of my books&quot;, &quot;Writing...&quot;, &quot;Designer Mindset Members&quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don&apos;t get lost in endless consumption but create purposeful interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a day, I go through the &quot;For You&quot; tab as it gives me good suggestions and helps me explore new people to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are primarily working on learning 3D design, you can create a list of 3D designers. This way, you won&apos;t be distracted by all other ideas that can be tempting. You can keep your focus and inspiration in one area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/dash.png&quot; alt=&quot;dash&quot; class=&quot;max-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Removing distractions from Safari and Internet browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t have multiple tabs open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&apos;m online to publish an article or send a newsletter like this one, I go to my Ghost dashboard and publish it. Then onto the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the many ways to help me stay focused on my creative endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As little context switching and distractions as possible. Setting up our environment for that plays a huge role in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, it doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t have spontaneous fun with my digital products. I do, but it is a choice. I can have 20 tabs open while exploring on a Saturday night. However, not while I&apos;m trying to get work done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article could go on and on! But I will stop here for now as I want to keep it condensed to share the idea. If you find such tips useful, please do let me know by replying to this email. I&apos;m happy to expand on this further.&lt;/p&gt;

My parents or anyone in my family have never invested. What a loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing now how my money grows. 💰&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m a father of 2 kids (5 &amp;amp; 8yo). One of first thing I&amp;#39;ll teach them is saving/investing/compounding...&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; oykun.com (@oykun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oykun/status/1458009050516492290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I tweeted about my regret in not investing earlier in life. I always thought I was in the minority who hasn&apos;t been investing at my age. To my surprise, I found out many others in similar age was in similar position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I wanted to extend the subject as I received numerous questions about this tweet. I will  keep it short and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is not a financial advice. Please do your own research, I&apos;m just sharing how I have been investing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read numerous articles and many finance/investment related books, they all give very similar advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Invest in long term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not a type of person to follow stock market daily and try to time the market. I just want to put some money in investment and forget about it while it is growing itself on a side. For this scenario, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Index Funds&lt;/a&gt; have been a life saver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80% of my investment goes to long term Index Funds. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; ISA account for Index Funds, it is trust worthy and has low fees. I did set up an £X of monthly direct debit payment from my bank to Vanguard and Vanguard to purchase Y% of each index fund monthly. It is all automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have made %40+ return in Index funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Diversify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to where to invest, the diversification becomes key. Yes I have my favourite Funds, however I try to keep a good balance between logic and emotion. I invest in ~15 Funds with different weights at the moment. Big majority is for S&amp;amp;P 500 (duh!), I also have some FTSE 100, Japan Stock Index, Target Retirement, Global Small Cap Index Fund, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your own research and diversify your money. So if one market does bad, an another will make it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Individual Stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, lets be honest, Index funds are boring :D  in this case, boring is good though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the remaining 20% of my money, I invest in Individual Stocks and Crypto. Currently I&apos;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://etoro.tw/3n68GH3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eToro&lt;/a&gt; for both, there are many other low fee alternatives for Stock market. I purchase stocks from the companies I know and believe in such as Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock market with Crypto is very volatile, looking at today, I have made ~%70 return&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Timing the Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may heard this phrase, people keep waiting for market price to go down to buy. In an ideal world, it makes sense, however we are living in a real and unpredictable world. Regardless market going up or down, you loose opportunity by waiting. I invest regularly without timing. If you look at it in the long term, your money grows despite all the volatilities. I don&apos;t sell when market goes down and people panic sells, I see these times as great opportunities to buy even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can write pages of advice for this subject, even a book :D Maybe I should : P &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have follow up articles. For now, if you want to start investing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Open an Vanguard ISA (up to £20k tax-free for UK) account.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Transfer whatever you can afford from your personal bank account to Vanguard. £100, £1000, ...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Buy some Index Fund, S&amp;amp;P 500 is the most common one, it is even taken as benchmark. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Congrats, you have invested now : ) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Then, keep doing your research and expand your portfolio with more funds and stocks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember; Invest in long term, Diversify, Don&apos;t stress to time the market, Stay calm ... It is not that complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I&amp;#39;m 38 years old &amp;amp; I found out about investing my money at the age of 36!

&lt;h2&gt;Replacing smartphone with a book.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to read more and we always struggle finding time for it. I used to be in the same situation and feel guilty of not reading enough. After all, how could I even find time with 2 kids, day time job, multiple side projects, list goes on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;During the past few months, I replaced my phone with a book and this happened 📚+ kindle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I had a moment here and there, while waiting in line, walking to tube, lunch time, ... I grabbed my book instead of phone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out I actually have had enough time to read 🤷‍♂️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/eURbLh47Sb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/eURbLh47Sb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; oykun.com (@oykun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oykun/status/1196430204081725441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 18, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it is an old tweet and it proves the effectiveness as it still stands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that we need to spare a big chunk of time during the day to read. Yes, that would be ideal but if you can&apos;t do that, use the little bits of 5-10 minutes here and there in your day to read. It quickly adds up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, we no longer have as much opportunity since the Covid lockdowns have started. I no longer commute to work, however I still have that time in my day, it is up to me to choose how to use it. Plus I still have lots of opportunities here and there, on the way to school to pick up kids, while walking to shops, waiting in line for grocery, waiting sleep to kick in after getting in bed, list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few simple tips that have helped me to read more;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Always carry a book. Kindle or physical.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pick up your book instead of your phone when you have a moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once you start using these bits of time to read, you will naturally want to create time for reading as you fall back in love with reading and want to finish that page, section, then the whole book. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Replacing smartphone with a book.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/article-howireadmore.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/article-howireadmore.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Get up when you Wake up</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/get-up-when-you-wake-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Get up when you Wake up" /><published>2021-04-30T01:01:01+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-30T01:01:01+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/get-up-when-you-wake-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/get-up-when-you-wake-up.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article-getup.png&quot; class=&quot;max-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We all have 24 hours in a day. Entrepreneur to 5 products and 4 kids with well balanced life or a single full time employee who struggles to find time to do a simple reading/writing.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my previous post about &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/new-challanges.html&quot; title=&quot;New Challenges&quot;&gt;New Challenges&lt;/a&gt;, I have started a full time job after many years of freelancing. One of the first challenges I&apos;ve been facing is better time and energy management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I used to freelance, I was was able to work on multiple things during the day including my personal projects, client projects, accounting errands, home errands, so on... However my current role in the Investment Banking requires me to join many meetings during the day and make sure that product teams have the designs they need to proceed in agreed timelines. So, once the working hours start, I&apos;m 100% in this full time work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled to manage personal projects and errands during the first few weeks. I can no longer do long nights to catch up on things. At least for now, it is how it is. I ran out of energy and creativity after a long day of work and meetings. I&apos;m hoping to adjust to this new pace in coming days and weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for now what I do is, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I get up when I wake up.&lt;/strong&gt; I know it sounds silly, however I believe it applies to most of us, alarm goes off or we just wake up but we waste 10, 15+ mins turning in bed if not longer, fall asleep for 5mins, wake up again, so on and on... You don&apos;t get the rest you are after nor use the time for something productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I just get up as soon as I wake up. I put my alarm for 5:30am, but I guess my mental alarm works better after a few days of training and I wake up sometime between 5:00 and 5:30am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives me about 1.5 hours before kids wake up and all the meetings start. I must say I don&apos;t remember when I was so productive last time! There is something magical about that early morning with fresh mind. I get so much done in that ~1h and I&apos;m looking forward to expand it 2h+. I&apos;ll try getting up 5am next week, and move to 4:30am next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no much I want to do out of work without neglecting my family and personal health. I still get to spend time with my kids after work, and time with my wife after kids go to bed, and while everybody is in sleep in early morning, I have my time to do whatever I see value at; read, write, code, design, ...&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We all have 24 hours in a day.

&lt;h2&gt;Don&apos;t fear to take new challenges bigger than you&apos;ve ever dealt with. Remember, we don&apos;t grow when things are easy, we grow when we face challenges.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a personal update article. I wanted to document my thought process behind this radical decision I have taken in my career. A direction I thought I&apos;d never take. I guess &quot;Never Say Never&quot; proves itself true again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have accepted a job offer from a Tier 1 Investment Bank as a Vice President of Design role to work on Design Systems and Financial Product designs that heavily relies on data. This has been my first month and yes I certainly have taken a challenge! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a self taught designer and (used-to-be) developer. The way I&apos;ve learned all my skills has been by taking new challenges in the real world with real projects. I&apos;ve written more about that earlier at &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oykun.com/2013/self-taught-with-passion.html&quot; title=&quot;Self-taught with Passion&quot;&gt;Self-taught with Passion&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, but why? Well, things have been going a bit too well in my freelance world. I have had lots of interesting projects coming through, I have met new people, made good earning, had my own schedule... All and all good, I&apos;m very grateful for all of it but the biggest challenge I was able to take was based on the projects, and all I was able to improve with those were technical skills. However I wanted to learn a completely new business and focus more on improving my soft skills in an another level such as time-management, presentation, communication, managing teams and projects in a new environment, working with people in person... This job offer has it all and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be sharing my learnings in the coming weeks and months in this blog. However so far, I love the difficult and challenging situation I&apos;ve put myself in! There is so much I need to learn and improve to make this job going as well as my freelancing experience. I&apos;m excited to improve myself and share with you all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Don&apos;t fear to take new challenges bigger than you&apos;ve ever dealt with.

&lt;h2&gt;It is not What you know but Who!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably cover this subject in a series of articles. For today I wanted to write about the important of connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while I was playing Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I heard Tifa saying Cloud about the importance of making connections to get more jobs and she was encouraging Cloud to meet more people in Midgar city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so relatable to our creative industry, to any industry actually. You can be a highly experienced and skilled designer, but if you don&apos;t have connections, you may struggle to get the lead for that dream project of yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You need to be the first name that comes to mind when someone needs a designer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that you need to put yourself out there. Share your work, experiments, experiences at the platforms like Instagram, Dribbble, Twitter, etc where you can make connections. You need to actively build connections and meet as many people as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Trust is the key! A potential client would be willing to pay more to a designer with less experience, but recommended by a trusted friend. A less risky option is more valuable to a client&apos;s business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb5&quot;&gt;I have involved in hundreds of projects in my ~20 years of experience, and the bigger part of the best projects I have involved came from recommendations. It usually starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent-speech&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Oykun, you have worked with one of my friend, he was impressed with the work you did for him and recommended me to contact you...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent-speech&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Oykun, I need a design work and the designer I always work with isn&apos;t available at the momet and she recommended I reach out to you as she has been following your work...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent-speech&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Oykun, I have been following your work for a while, and now that I&apos;m building my own business, I thought I would reach out to you...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt5&quot;&gt;If you can put yourself in this position, you will already beat the 90% of competition. Now you just need to build your relation with the potential client in a friendly way and share how you can improve their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing time in improving technical skills is very important, but make sure to give enough time to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Make connections, Share your work and the dream projects will find you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It is not What you know but Who!

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve never had a mentor, but I&apos;ve had heroes. I&apos;ve put myself in their shoes when I need to make design or business decisions. I&apos;ve worked hard to align quality of my work to my heroes. I can&apos;t mention a single name, there have been so many of them. Btw, it doesn&apos;t have to be for the design industry, isn&apos;t it same when we are trying to be a better parent or partner, taking examples from our own parents or so... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have an amazing community who is more than happy to help each other. I personally know designers from big corporations to individual freelancers offering free mentoring. In my 20 years of experience, I have received countless emails, messages asking for advice. I&apos;m humbled by it and I have been doing my very best to respond every one of them in my limited time. This is one of the reason why I have started this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this ease of communication also made the contribution from some experienced designers more challenging. There is just not enough time to respond all, mentor all individually. We should not be discouraged with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not need to be in active communication with our heros (which would make them mentors), however we can follow their work, blog, Twitter, etc. to have an understanding of what they are up to, how they are approaching to certain situations and learn from them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have countless heroes to learn from instead of waiting for a space in one&apos;s already tight calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
