	<p>Most of us, designers, are working from home now and we are lucky to be able to do that. However it certainly comes with its challenges with staying creative and motivated. Especially if you are not used to work from home.</p>

<p>There are many factors to it from not having enough sleep to not having a separate work space, necessary tools, fast broadband connection, so on... These are all acceptable reasons, but there is one overlooked factor I believe, </p>

<blockquote>Look good, feel good.</blockquote>

<p>It is easy to fall in the trap of staying in PJs whole day long. This can sound amazing at first. I'm sure you have heard freelancers bragging about <i>"Working in my boxes ðŸ™ƒ"</i>. While this is technically possible, I find it very demotivating.  </p>

</div>

<p>For the bigger part of my career, I have been working from home and I built some habits in years to stay productive and creative.</p>

<blockquote>Every morning I dress up like going to office. Not necessarily putting on smart suits, but clean and comfortable clothes that I feel good in. This helps me to feel good and do a better job in my design work.  </blockquote>

<p>This may not an effective factor for every one out there, but I hope at least this can make to question some simple and overlooked factors of yours. </p>

<p>Let's keep in good mood. :)</p>
