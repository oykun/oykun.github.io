    <h2>Don't fear to take new challenges bigger than you've ever dealt with. Remember, we don't grow when things are easy, we grow when we face challenges.</h2>
<p>This is more of a personal update. I wanted to document my thought process behind this radical decision for my career. A direction I thought I'd never take. I guess "never say never" proves itself true again.</p>

<p>I have accepted a job offer from a Tier1 Investment Bank as a Vice President of Design role. This  has been my first month and yes I certainly have taken a challenge! </p>

<p>I'm a self taught designer and (used-to-be) developer. The way I've learned all my skills has been taking new challenges in the real world with real projects. I've written more about that earlier at "<a href="https://oykun.com/2013/self-taught-with-passion.html" title="Self-taught with Passion">Self-taught with Passion</a>". </p>

<p>Things have been going a bit too well in my freelance world. I have had lots of interesting projects coming through, I have met new people, made good earning, had my own schedule... All and all good, I'm very grateful for all of it but the biggest challenge I was able to take was based on the projects, and all I was able to improve with those were technical skills. However I wanted to learn a completely new business and focus more on improving my soft skills in an another level such as time-management, presentation, communication, managing teams and projects in a new environment, working with people in person... This job offer has it all and more.</p>

<p>I will share my learnings in coming weeks and months in here. However so far, I love the difficult situation I've put myself in! There is so much I need to learn to make this job going as well as my freelancing experience. I'm excited to improve myself and share with you all.</p>
